Groups are an easy, intuitive way to recommend content to a specific set of learners. You can create groups of learners in your Learning account and recommend courses or learning paths to everyone in the group at one time.

### Add groups via Admin Center

### Add groups automatically via SSO using custom attributes

From your SSO custom attributes, you can dynamically create groups and assign members to those by selecting Assign Groups during the custom attribute creation process. When you select this feature, a new group will be created for each unique value of that custom attribute, and the newly created groups will contain learners who have the same corresponding values.

### Automatically assign and remove users from groups via SCIM

If you are using SSO as your authentication method, you could benefit from provisioning groups and group memberships in LinkedIn Learning automatically.

The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification is designed to make managing user identities in cloud-based applications and services like LinkedIn Learning easier. By utilizing SCIM, you can automate user provisioning and de-provisioning and keep user attributes and group memberships up to date with your internal systems.

LinkedIn Learning currently supports SCIM integrations with the following Identity Providers:

* [SCIM provisioning via Azure Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/learning/user-and-attribute-management/user-attribute-mgmt-docs/azure-ad-auto-provisioning)
* [SCIM provisioning via Okta](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/learning/user-and-attribute-management/user-attribute-mgmt-docs/okta-scim)
* [SCIM provisioning via OneLogin](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/learning/user-and-attribute-management/user-attribute-mgmt-docs/onelogin-scim)

## Recommending content to your group of users

As a Learning admin, you can curate, recommend, and share custom learning paths and collections to your learners. Learning paths curated by LinkedIn Learning are also available to recommend to, or share with your learners. You can edit these learning paths to customize them to the unique needs of your organization.
