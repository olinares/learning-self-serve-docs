## LinkedIn Profile binding

**Access LinkedIn Learning and connect your LinkedIn profile.**

The way you access LinkedIn Learning will depend on the configuration choices made for your organization.
Organizations can choose whether to enable Single Sign-On (SSO) for LinkedIn Learning, or not, and whether to
require, make optional, or not allow learners to connect their LinkedIn profile to their LinkedIn Learning account.

### Benefits of connecting your LinkedIn profile to your LinkedIn Learning account

When you connect your LinkedIn profile to your LinkedIn Learning account, you will get personalized and
interactive learning experiences. Benefits to connecting your LinkedIn profile include:

* Share your learning achievements: Add Certificates of Completion and skills to your LinkedIn profile and
share LinkedIn Learning videos with your network.
* Watch courses with your connections and colleagues: See who else is learning with you and build
connections.
* Receive customized content recommendations: Get recommendations based on what your connections and
similar professionals are viewing, as well as recommendations based on your LinkedIn profile.
* Join learning groups: Deepen your learning by engaging other like-minded learners who have similar career
aspirations.
* Ask questions and get answers: Use Q&A to continue the conversation beyond the course with peers and
instructors.
